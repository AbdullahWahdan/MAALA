The platform will integrate multiple agents to extract, summarize, and analyze content from various sources, including PDFs, educational videos, and online articles. The expected outcomes include a fully functional platform that provides a user-friendly interface for students to interact with, and a technical deliverable that includes three core agents and a central orchestrator.",
