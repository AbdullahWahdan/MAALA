The context is more of a project description and doesn't provide a functional implementation of the Search Agent.\n\nHowever, I can suggest a hypothetical example of how the Search Agent might work:\n\nLet's say you want to find a video that explains linear algebra concepts. You could ask the Search Agent, and it might use the following steps:\n\n1. Use NLP to analyze your query and extract relevant keywords (e.g., \"linear algebra\").\n2. Index relevant videos in the database using their metadata (e.g., title, description, tags).\n3. Use a vector search algorithm (e.g., FAISS) to find the top N videos that match your query based on their vector representations.\n4. Rank the results based on relevance and provide a list of recommended videos.\n\nAgain, this is a hypothetical example, and the actual implementation of the Search Agent would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.",
